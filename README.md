# Wherewewere
A one-time time-capsule of information stored into the blockchain that can only be created by participants during the event (2-5 hrs) via smart contract.

(no accounts or anything for the proof-of-concept), one can make an event or see other events on it. When an event is made, a corresponding smart contract will be made with the title and description and a QR code will be given to the host. When the event time starts, people who follow the correct URL at the right time can post to the site which the posts a TX with the message from the site address to the event address. The event address will only accept input from the sitewide site address.

Picture files will be stored as ipfs.pics links, so proof-of-concept will have users send ipfs.pics links they have manually uploaded?
