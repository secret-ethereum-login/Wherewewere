navigate to front-end tools directory in terminal
https://nodejs.org/en/download/
install node.js
run 'npm install' in terminal

..make sure the node modules do not get committed... they are really big

open gulpfile.js

        host: 'what.local',  //your localhost
        proxy: 'what.local', //your localhost again

        change these to your localhost
        run 'gulp' in your terminal

        all terminal commands without quotes
        gulp will automatically minify and compress javascript and convert sass into css

        make changes only to front-end-tools/javascript/functions.js
        and styling to styles/style.scss

        run gulp gzip-tar to backup entire project.... this is saved into the backups folder

        also this gulp instance has browser sync so will refresh the browser screen when changes are made
